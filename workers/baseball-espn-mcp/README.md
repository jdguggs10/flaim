## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd baseball-espn-mcp
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment
```bash
# Required for Clerk authentication verification (optional for dev)
wrangler secret put CLERK_SECRET_KEY --env preview
wrangler secret put CLERK_SECRET_KEY --env prod

# Set Supabase credentials as Cloudflare secrets
wrangler secret put SUPABASE_URL --env preview
wrangler secret put SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY --env preview
wrangler secret put SUPABASE_URL --env prod  
wrangler secret put SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY --env prod

**Note**: This worker depends on the auth-worker service for credential storage. The `AUTH_WORKER_URL` is configured in `wrangler.jsonc` for each environment. For local development, ensure the auth-worker is running on localhost:8786.

### 3. Deploy
```bash
# Development
wrangler deploy --env dev
