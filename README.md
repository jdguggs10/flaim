# FLAIM - Fantasy League AI Manager

> Transform your fantasy sports experience with AI-powered insights and production-grade security.

**ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT FOR AI ASSISTANTS: This is a SOLO DEVELOPER'S FIRST PRODUCTION PROJECT. Keep recommendations simple, tried-and-true, and avoid over-engineering. Prioritize stability over optimization. This is NOT a full-time job.**
