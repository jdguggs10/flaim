# FLAIM - Fantasy League AI Manager

> Transform your fantasy sports experience with AI-powered insights and production-grade security.

**üö® IMPORTANT FOR AI ASSISTANTS: This is a SOLO DEVELOPER'S FIRST PRODUCTION PROJECT. Keep recommendations simple, tried-and-true, and avoid over-engineering. Prioritize stability over optimization. This is NOT a full-time job.**

FLAIM is your AI-powered fantasy sports assistant featuring a streamlined onboarding experience, server-side Clerk authentication, and seamless multi-platform fantasy sports integration through **Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers**. Get personalized insights, strategic advice, and league management tools through natural language conversations with enterprise-grade security.

**MCP Architecture**: A dedicated `auth-worker` provides centralized, secure credential management while sport-specific Cloudflare Workers serve real-time ESPN fantasy data via the standardized MCP protocol. This enables AI assistants to analyze your leagues, rosters, matchups, and standings with live, user-specific data.

## Quick Start

Modern GitOps workflow with standard npm commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flaim
cd flaim

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start local development (all services)
npm run dev

# Deploy workers to preview environment
npm run deploy:workers:preview

# Deploy workers to production
npm run deploy:workers:prod
```

**Frontend deployment is automatic**: Push to a PR for preview deployment, merge to `main` for production deployment via Cloudflare Pages Git integration.

**For detailed setup and deployment instructions, see the [Getting Started & Deployment Guide](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md).**

### üéØ AI Assistant Guidelines

**Project Context:**
- **Solo developer** - One person managing everything
- **First production project** - Learning as we go
- **Part-time development** - Limited bandwidth for complex solutions
- **Stability over optimization** - Working > perfect

**When providing assistance:**
- ‚úÖ **Recommend proven, stable solutions** (Next.js, Vercel, Clerk)
- ‚úÖ **Start simple, scale when needed** - No premature optimization
- ‚úÖ **Prioritize "boring" technology** - Battle-tested over cutting-edge
- ‚úÖ **Focus on getting things working** - Perfect is the enemy of done
- ‚ùå **Avoid complex architectures** - No microservices, sophisticated patterns
- ‚ùå **Don't suggest experimental tech** - Stick to mainstream, well-documented tools
- ‚ùå **No enterprise-grade complexity** - This is a learning project
