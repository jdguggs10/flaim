# FLAIM Platform Deployment Guide v4.1

## üöÄ One-Click Deployment (Recommended)

### Local Development
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flaim
cd flaim
./setup.sh              # One-time setup
./start-dev.sh          # Start all services
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flaim  
cd flaim
./start-prod.sh         # Deploy to production
```

**Done!** The setup and deployment scripts handle all configuration, dependencies, secrets, and deployment automatically.

## Platform Components

FLAIM consists of three main components:

1. **ü§ñ Next.js Frontend** (`/openai`) - *Main Application*
   - Clerk authentication, OpenAI chat interface
   - Usage tracking (100 free messages/month)

2. **‚öæ Baseball ESPN MCP** (`/workers/baseball-espn-mcp`) - *Open Access Service*
   - ESPN Fantasy Baseball integration (`baseball-espn-mcp`)

3. **üèà Football ESPN MCP** (`/workers/football-espn-mcp`) - *Multi-Sport Extension*
   - ESPN Fantasy Football integration (`football-espn-mcp`)

## Manual Deployment (If Needed)

### Prerequisites
- **OpenAI API key** - Get from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
- **Cloudflare Workers account** - For MCP service hosting  
- **Node.js 18+** and npm
- **Clerk already configured** (keys available)

### Manual Steps (if not using quickstart scripts)

1. **Deploy Baseball Worker**: `cd workers/baseball-espn-mcp && wrangler deploy --env prod`
2. **Deploy Football Worker**: `cd workers/football-espn-mcp && wrangler deploy --env prod`  
3. **Deploy Frontend**: `cd openai && npm run build && npx @cloudflare/next-on-pages`

### Development URLs (Local)
- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Baseball Worker: `http://localhost:8787`
- Football Worker: `http://localhost:8788`

## Environment Configuration

### üìÑ Environment Files

The quickstart scripts use `.env.example` as a template. For manual setup:

#### Frontend (`.env.local`)
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
```

#### Worker Secrets (Both Workers)
```bash
ENCRYPTION_KEY=32-character-base64-key  # openssl rand -base64 32
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...           # Same as frontend
```

**Note**: Quickstart scripts handle all secret configuration automatically.

## Monitoring & Troubleshooting

### Health Checks
```bash
# Test worker health (URLs from production-info.md)
curl https://baseball-espn-mcp-prod.your-subdomain.workers.dev/health
curl https://football-espn-mcp-prod.your-subdomain.workers.dev/health
```

### Logs
```bash
wrangler tail baseball-espn-mcp-prod      # Baseball worker
wrangler tail football-espn-mcp-prod      # Football worker
```

### Common Issues
- **Usage limit exceeded**: User reached 100 free messages
- **ESPN API errors**: Check if credentials are stored/expired
- **MCP connection issues**: Verify worker URLs and health
