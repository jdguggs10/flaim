## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Next.js 15 Route Handler Signatures**: Updated onboarding route handlers to use Promise-based `params` destructuring for compatibility with `app/api` in Next.js 15.
- **TypeScript API DTOs**: Introduced reusable request/response interfaces in `types/api-responses.ts` and cast all JSON responses accordingly, eliminating `unknown` types during builds.
- **Build Failures**: Resolved compilation errors in `platform-selection`, `platform-credentials`, and `status` onboarding routes.

### Changed
- **React Upgrade**: Core platform migrated from React 18 to **React 19.1.0** with unified type definitions (`@types/react` 19.0.0) across all workspaces.
- **Next.js Upgrade**: Bumped framework to **Next.js 15.3.4** and aligned `eslint-config-next` accordingly.
- **Dependency Hygiene**: Removed workspace-local `@types/react*` declarations; root `overrides` now enforces a single version of React runtime and types, eliminating duplicate-types build errors.
- **Radix & ShadCN Primitives**: Refactored remaining UI primitives to the new `ComponentPropsWithoutRef` pattern required by React 19.
- **Docs**: Updated Architecture and Onboarding docs to reflect React 19 stack.

### Documentation
- Updated `docs/ONBOARDING.md` with new endpoints, DTO type location, and type safety notes.
