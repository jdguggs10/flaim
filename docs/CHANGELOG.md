## [Unreleased]

## [7.1.0] - 2025-12-28

### 🤖 ChatGPT Direct Access - Now Working!
Users can connect Flaim to ChatGPT as a custom MCP connector with OAuth 2.1, bringing their own subscription.

### OpenAI ChatGPT OAuth Support
- **Added**: ChatGPT redirect URIs to OAuth allowlist.
- **Added**: RFC 8707 `resource` propagation through OAuth code/token storage.
- **Added**: `securitySchemes` on all MCP tool definitions.
- **Added**: `_meta["mcp/www_authenticate"]` on 401 responses (initial connect + invalid tokens).
- **Fixed**: Refresh token flow preserves `resource` for audience-aware tokens.

## [7.0.0] - 2025-12-28

### 🎉 Claude Direct Access - Now Working!
Users can now connect Flaim to Claude.ai or Claude Desktop as a custom MCP connector. This enables "bring your own Claude subscription" usage, shifting AI costs to users while providing full access to ESPN fantasy data.

### OAuth 2.1 for Claude Direct Access
- **Added**: Full MCP OAuth 2.1 implementation for Claude Desktop/Claude.ai integration.
- **Added**: Dynamic Client Registration (RFC 7591) - `/register` and `/auth/register` endpoints.
- **Added**: Protected Resource Metadata (RFC 9728) - `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` on MCP workers.
- **Added**: Authorization Server Metadata (RFC 8414) - includes `registration_endpoint`.
- **Added**: Support for loopback redirect URIs (RFC 8252) for Claude Desktop.
- **Added**: `get_user_session` tool - returns user's configured leagues, team IDs, and current season context.
- **Changed**: MCP servers now return 401 on `initialize` to trigger OAuth immediately on connect.
- **Changed**: WWW-Authenticate header points to Protected Resource Metadata URL.
- **Added**: Rate limiting (200 calls/day per user) with appropriate headers.
- **Added**: Consent screen at `/oauth/consent` for user authorization.
- **Added**: Connectors page at `/connectors` for connection management.

### Critical Fix: Worker-to-Worker Routing
- **Fixed**: MCP workers now use `.workers.dev` URLs for auth-worker calls instead of custom domain.
- **Root cause**: Custom domain (`api.flaim.app`) caused HTTP 522 timeouts for intra-zone Cloudflare requests.
- **Impact**: `get_user_session` and all MCP tools now work correctly via Claude direct access.

### Other Fixes
- Note: OpenAI usage now references the **Responses API** (not legacy chat completions).
- Fix: Strip custom-domain prefixes for auth/baseball/football workers; avoid 404s.
- Fix: Credential check returns 200 with `hasCredentials: false` instead of 404.
- Fix: Trailing slash env URLs no longer break onboarding; timeouts resolved by direct URLs.
- Security: JWKS-based JWT verification enforced in prod; workers forward `Authorization`.
- Infra: Secrets for prod workers set via Cloudflare Dashboard (not `wrangler secret put`).
- Docs: Added onboarding explanation, DNS setup, and timeout/404 troubleshooting.
