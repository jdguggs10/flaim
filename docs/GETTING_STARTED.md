# Getting Started with FLAIM v5.0

**FLAIM (Fantasy League AI Manager)** is your AI-powered fantasy sports assistant with modular authentication, usage limits, and multi-sport ESPN integration through MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools.

## What is FLAIM?

FLAIM revolutionizes fantasy sports management by providing:
- **AI-powered chat assistant** for fantasy sports questions
- **Free tier**: 100 AI messages per month
- **Multi-sport ESPN integration** for baseball and football
- **Cross-platform authentication** ready for web and iOS
- **Open MCP access** for external AI assistants

Instead of juggling multiple apps and spreadsheets, you can ask natural language questions like:
- *"How did my team perform this week?"*
- *"Who should I start at shortstop today?"*
- *"Analyze this trade proposal for me"*

## Quick Start (10 minutes)

### What You'll Need

1. **Email address** for account creation
2. **OpenAI API key** (for AI chat)
3. **Cloudflare Workers account** (free tier)
4. **ESPN Fantasy Baseball league** (optional, for private leagues)

### Step 1: Set Up Authentication

1. Create a **Clerk account** at [clerk.com](https://clerk.com)
2. Create a new application in Clerk dashboard
3. Get your **Publishable Key** and **Secret Key**
4. Configure sign-in options (email/password recommended)

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flaim
cd flaim

# Install all dependencies from monorepo root (hoists shared packages)
npm install

# Build the shared auth package
cd auth
npm run build  # Builds shared, workers, and web targets

# The auth package now provides scoped imports:
# @flaim/auth/shared - Core authentication logic
# @flaim/auth/workers/espn/storage - ESPN credential storage for workers
# @flaim/auth/web/components - React components for Next.js
# @flaim/auth/web/server - Server-side auth helpers
# @flaim/auth/web/middleware - Clerk middleware
```

### Step 3: Deploy MCP Workers

```bash
# Deploy Baseball Worker
cd ../workers/baseball-espn-mcp
# No need to npm install - dependencies already hoisted from root

# Required: Set encryption key for credential storage
wrangler secret put ENCRYPTION_KEY  # Generate: openssl rand -base64 32

# Required for production: Set Clerk secret for server-side verification
wrangler secret put CLERK_SECRET_KEY  # sk_test_... from Clerk dashboard

# Optional: Set ESPN credentials for development testing only
# (These only work when NODE_ENV=development)
# wrangler secret put ESPN_S2      # Your espn_s2 cookie
# wrangler secret put ESPN_SWID    # Your SWID cookie

# Deploy to Cloudflare (NODE_ENV=production set automatically)
wrangler deploy --env prod

# Optional: Deploy Football Worker
cd ../football-espn-mcp
# No need to npm install - dependencies already hoisted from root
wrangler secret put ENCRYPTION_KEY  # Same key as baseball worker
wrangler secret put CLERK_SECRET_KEY  # Same key as baseball worker
wrangler deploy --env prod
```

### Step 4: Deploy Next.js Frontend

```bash
cd ../../openai

# Dependencies already installed from root npm workspace

# Create environment file
cp .env.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local with your keys:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key
# NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
# CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...

# Start locally
npm run dev

# Or deploy to Vercel
npx vercel deploy --prod
```

### Step 5: Create Your Account

1. Visit your FLAIM application
2. Click **"Sign Up"** to create your account
3. Complete Clerk registration flow
4. You'll start with **15 free AI messages**

### Step 6: Start Chatting!

Ask your AI assistant:
> *"Hello! Help me understand my fantasy baseball team performance."*

For private league access, configure ESPN credentials in the tools panel.

## What's New in v5.0

### üèóÔ∏è **Monorepo Architecture**
- **True NPM workspace**: Root package.json with proper dependency hoisting
- **Single Next.js instance**: Eliminates duplicate dependencies and type conflicts
- **Separated build targets**: Shared, workers, and web code compile independently
- **Scoped imports**: Clean `@flaim/auth/*` imports instead of relative paths
- **Client/server separation**: Prevents "server-only" errors in React components
